  The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a
  consonant. It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article
  indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you might
  ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking
  about a specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you.
   Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably
   doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. Consider the following
   examples of indefinite articles used in context:

    Uncountable nouns are nouns that are either difficult or impossible to count. Uncountable nouns include
     intangible things (e.g., information, air), liquids (e.g., milk, wine), and things that are too large
     or numerous to count (e.g., equipment, sand, wood). Because these things can’t be counted, you should
      never use a or an with them—remember, the indefinite article is only for singular nouns. Uncountable
      nouns can be modified by words like some, however. Consider the examples below for reference:
